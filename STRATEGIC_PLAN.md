# Strategic Upgrade Plan: Project-Victor-Prime

## Executive Summary
This document outlines three strategic upgrade trajectories for Project-Victor-Prime, an advanced cognitive architecture system. The project combines modular AI components with sophisticated world modeling, physics simulation, and causal reasoning capabilities. These trajectories address critical areas: modular architecture enhancement, cognitive architecture implementation, and production readiness.

## Interdependencies Between Trajectories

### Trajectory 1 ↔ Trajectory 2
- The SAVE3 envelope system (Trajectory 1) will encapsulate the Reality Engine components (Trajectory 2)
- Module discovery and compatibility negotiation depend on well-defined cognitive architecture interfaces
- Both must align on API contracts and data exchange formats

### Trajectory 1 ↔ Trajectory 3
- Production readiness (Trajectory 3) provides the infrastructure for secure module loading and validation
- Module signing and verification systems require production-grade security measures
- Testing infrastructure must validate both modular architecture and cognitive components

### Trajectory 2 ↔ Trajectory 3
- The Reality Engine requires production-grade training infrastructure
- Performance monitoring and observability must track cognitive architecture metrics
- Security considerations apply to all cognitive components

## Implementation Roadmap
